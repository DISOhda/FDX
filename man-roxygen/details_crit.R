#' @details
#' Computing critical constants (`critical.values = TRUE`) requires considerably
#' more execution time, especially if the number of unique supports is large.
#' We recommend that users should only have them calculated when they need them,
#' e.g. for illustrating the rejection area in a plot or other theoretical
#' reasons.

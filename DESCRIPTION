Description: Multiple testing procedures for heterogeneous and discrete tests as
    described in Döhler and Roquain (2019) <arXiv:1912.04607v1>. The main 
    algorithms of the paper are available as continuous, discrete and weighted
    versions. They take as input the results of a test procedure from package
    'DiscreteTests', or a set of observed p-values and their discrete support
    under their nulls. A shortcut function to obtain such p-values and supports
    is also provided, along with wrappers allowing to apply discrete procedures
    directly to data.
